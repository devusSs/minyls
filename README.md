# minyls - Go tool to combine MinIO and YOURLS

minyls is a Go tool to ease up the process of storing files using [MinIO](https://min.io/) and shortening the presigned URLs via [YOURLS](https://yourls.org/). This tool was written for this very specific purpose of the author and will probably be no use for other people.
